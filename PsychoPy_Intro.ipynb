    "# Getting Started with PsychoPy\n",
    "[Psychopy](http://psychopy.org/) is an open-source application for running and presenting experimental stimuli. This tutorial aims to introduce users to the PsychoPy coder and IDE. In this tutorial we'll go over:\n",
    "- Installing PsychoPy\n",
    "- Using the 'Coder' IDE\n",
    "- Coding a basic stroop task\n",
    "- Saving and exporting response data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why PsychoPy? \n",
    "* It's open-source, so there is fairly extensive documentation and a user community to help solve provlems\n",
    "* You're more familiar with Python or object-oriented programming\n",
    "* It's free (no liscencing or dongles to lose)\n",
    "* Flexible for different learning styles/levels of detail (good for programmers and non-programmers)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why *not* PsychoPy?\n",
    "* Open-source means lots of versions and inevitable compatibility issues\n",
    "* IDE is not conducive to in-line debugging\n",
    "* You like your current presentation software/tools"

    "# Resources\n",
    "One of the things that drew me to PsychoPy (besides a lab that already used it) was the extensive documentation and tutorials that were already available! Below are a few resources that I quickly found via Google as well as those that I've used in the past.\n",
    "- In general, I've found PsychoPy's [Discourse page](https://discourse.psychopy.org/) particiularly helpful\n",
    "\n",
    "### Builder View ####\n",
    "While this tutorial doesn't go over the Builder View, it's a GUI system that works well for quick learning and simple experimental designs. There's a LOT of documetation out there for help using the Builder View. Here are just a few:\n",
    "- [From PsychoPy](http://www.psychopy.org/builder/builder.html)\n",
    "- [And as a YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV6qhuQgsiI)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coder View ####\n",
    "- PsychoPy's [API](http://psychopy.org/api/api.html) is quite thorough, and good for going through all of the different settings for a given module\n",
    "- This [tutorial](https://www.socsci.ru.nl/wilberth/nocms/psychopy/print.php) and this [workshop](https://lindeloev.net/psychopy-course/) that goes over some programming skills as well\n",
    "- If reading chapters are your thing, [PsychoPy Is Fun!](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-64066-2_3.pdf)\n"

PsychoPy has a number of ways to install the software, many of which are listed [here](http://psychopy.org/download.html#download) if you want to try and use the newer version. "

    "# The Coder View\n",

    "PsychoPy's coder view is an rough-around-the-eduges IDE where you'll create and run your experiment scripts. There are a few important components:\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, the most important buttons you will use are the green 'go' button and the red 'stop' button. These will start and stop your script. Other useful tools on the header include the new/save files (first two buttons on the left) and the monitor center (the button with two monitors).\n",
    "\n",
    "![footer](misc/psychopy2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "At the bottom of our IDE there are two important windows:\n",
    "- The output window will display any information automatically returned from your script, as well as error information when your code breaks. When I'm developing a task, I'll often return objects that I need my script to create so that I can check that everything is working the way I think it does.\n",
    "- The shell is a shell where you can run single lines of code. \n",
    "\n",
